The folders contain the following information:

1. Melting_temperatures_of_proteins

Contains csv files for each organism with melting temperatures for each protein

2. Features_for_each_protein

Contains csv files for each organism with the primary structure for each protein

3. embeddings_for_each_protein

Contains csv files for each organism with the embeddings for each protein

4. Datasets

Contains the datasets that were used to train the models.

5. trained models

Contains the files for the trained models

6. Predictions

Contains the prediction for each model on the testing dataset and the complete dataset.
Additonaly contains the tranformed dataset with the differences between predicted and experimentally determined melting temperatures, and metrics for the prediction quality. These datasets were used to create the pictures.

7. Pictures_corresponding_to_predictions

Contains the pictures for the dataset
